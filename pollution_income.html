    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Environmental justice is a central concern in urban and regional planning, particularly when examining how environmental burdens intersect with socioeconomic conditions. Traffic-related pollution, including air pollution and noise exposure, has been linked to adverse health outcomes and is often unevenly distributed across communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Washington State, major highways and high-traffic corridors pass through both economically advantaged and disadvantaged areas. This raises an important question:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Are lower-income communities more likely to be located near high-traffic areas, and therefore experience greater exposure to traffic-related pollution?</strong></p>
    <p>
      This project investigates the relationship between household income and proximity to high-traffic roadways across Washington State census tracts. While it is often assumed that lower-income communities bear a disproportionate share of environmental burdens, this analysis tests that assumption using spatial data, ranking metrics, and GIS-based methods.
    </p>

    <h2>Data & Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis uses publicly available data from the <strong>Washington Tracking Network (WTN)</strong>, maintained by the Washington State Department of Health. Ranking metrics were derived using the Information by Location (IBL) framework.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Washington State census tract boundaries</li>
      <li>Median household income ranks (IBL, ranked 1–10; higher rank indicates lower income)</li>
      <li>Traffic exposure proximity ranks (IBL, ranked 1–10; higher rank indicates greater proximity)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Census tracts with a traffic proximity rank of 7 or higher were selected to represent areas of high traffic exposure. These tracts were exported as a new layer, and centroid points were generated to represent exposure locations. Median household income ranks were spatially joined to each centroid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Centroids were then classified into low-income (rank ≥ 7) and high-income (rank ≤ 3) groups and symbolized accordingly to compare spatial patterns of traffic exposure. All analysis and visualization were conducted using <strong>QGIS</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <img src="final_project.png" alt="Traffic exposure and income in Washington State">
    <p>
      At the statewide level, high-income census tracts contained more high-traffic centroids (273) than low-income tracts (206). This finding challenges the assumption that traffic exposure is uniformly concentrated in lower-income communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, closer spatial analysis revealed important regional exceptions where low-income communities experience a disproportionate share of traffic exposure. These areas include South Seattle (Rainier Valley, South Park, Burien), Spokane, Bellingham, and several communities in southern Washington, including Woodland, Hazel Dell, Lincoln, Columbia Way, Carter Park, and Village at Fisher’s Landing in Vancouver.
    </p>
    <p>
      These localized patterns suggest that environmental burden is not solely determined by statewide totals, but by where exposure overlaps with vulnerable populations.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Implications</h2>
    <p>
      The findings of this analysis suggest that environmental justice interventions should prioritize <strong>place-based strategies</strong> rather than relying exclusively on statewide averages. Regions where low-income communities and high traffic exposure intersect may benefit most from targeted policies such as enhanced air quality monitoring, traffic mitigation measures, green infrastructure investments, and improved access to healthcare resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      By identifying specific geographic areas where environmental burdens and socioeconomic vulnerability overlap, GIS-based analysis can support more equitable transportation planning and public health decision-making.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      While traffic exposure is not exclusive to low-income communities in Washington State, this project demonstrates that significant localized disparities exist. These findings highlight the importance of examining environmental justice issues at multiple spatial scales and reinforce the role of GIS as a tool for identifying communities most in need of intervention.
